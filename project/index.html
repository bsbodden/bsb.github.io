        <p style="max-width: 60vw; margin: auto;">
            Fake news. You've heard that term before.
            You've likely even been recently exposed to fake news.
            Fake news affect public debate on the economy, the environment, healthcare,
            and it can directly affect the choices of politicians, voters, and the market.
            The Internet has made it possible to shift public perception
            in a way that was previously impossible.
            But have you ever stopped to think about fake news?
            How is it created, how does it spread, how does it impact you,
            and most importantly, what can you do about it?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section01">
        <h1>Start From the Source</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 60vw; margin: auto;">
            Fake news gain traction as they spread
            and change the perception of reality of those who believe
            it and further contribute to their spreading.
            However, in order for fake news to spread, someone has to create it to begin with. But who?
            Let's use COVID-19 as an example.
            A report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) showed that only 12 people
            were responsible for 65% of COVID-19 related lies on social media.
            Their massive followings and engagement allowed them to spread misinformation about the pandemic
            and question the effectiveness of vaccines.
            We have managed to obtain the Twitter interactions for 6 of those people,
            whose accounts have not been suspended, and what we found is
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> only takes as few as half a dozen people to create a deep network of
                lies</span>

        <p style="max-width: 80vw; margin: auto;">
            You may have noticed a few things: artists, politicians, ordinary people, doctors and "doctors",
            all of them receiving misinformation from a select few people on a deadly disease.
            But were they only talking about COVID-19?
            We made a word cloud of what the tweets from the Misinformation 6 were spreading, and it turns out
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> those who spread fake news, spread it about all topics.</span>

        <p style="max-width: 80vw; margin: auto;">
            From fossil fuels to pesticides, going through GMOs and even 5G,
            the Misinformation Dozen talk about topics of high socioeconomic relevance.
            The presence of agents who spread misinformation on social media
            disrupts public debate by making it hard to agree on the basic facts that ground a discussion.
            With all that said, what is the point of it?
            Why would someone dedicate time and resources just to spread falsehoods?
            But spreaders of misinformation don't just lie for the sake of it.
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> For every lie they spread, there is a goal to achieve, and a narrative to tell.</span>

            From everything you've seen so far, you may believe that spreading fake news is a recent phenomenon,
            a consequence of technology enabling people to reach the entire world instantly.
            While it is true that the term "fake news" only became current around 2016,
            fraudsters have been aware of the power of misinformation since long before that.
            While the Internet has allowed the dissemination of fake news on an unprecedented scale,

            So, even though fake news has gained a surge in recent years, it is actually older than sliced bread.
            So what's this buzz about misinformation now? Why should I care?
            If in 1693 one man with his printer in a basement in London could pose a threat against the king,
            and one fake letter in 1803 caused fortunes to be made and destroyed in stock exchanges,
            imagine the devastation that fake news powered by the internet could cause.
            Or don't imagine, you don't have to.
            Just look at COVID-19. Misinformation is used for personal profit.
            Misinformation shakes the trust in our institutions.

                            This interactive visualization allows you to explore the activities of the "Disinformation Half-Dozen",
                            6 of the 12 people responsive for 65% of disinformation about COVID-19 who still have active Twitter accounts.

                                <li><strong>By # of Tweets</strong> - The total number of times the person posted on Twitter. You can
                                    notice there's a large burst of this activity before the major COVID-19 spike in January, 2021.</li>
                                <li><strong>By # of Retweets</strong> - The total number of times the person was retweeted,
                                    which is when another person reposts their message directly. If the person retweeting
                                    has more followers than the original poster, this can strongly amplify the reach of the message.</li>
                                <li><strong>By # of Favorites</strong> - The total number of times the person received a "like."
                                    This is an indication of how many people read and reacted to their posts.</li>

                            <strong>Days to Aggregate</strong> - On the right you can choose the number of days added together to create
                            a single time period that is plotted. When set to 1 day, the data shows individual days and is hard to read,
                            but as you increase the aggregation and view the sums of days, it becomes smoother. Play with the various
                            aggregations to see if any patterns are revealed.<br/><br/>
                            <strong>Cases, Deaths, and Both (Log 10)</strong> - Choose either cases of COVID-19 or deaths due to it
                            to compare against the creation of disinformation. Selecting "Both (Log 10)" displays a logarithm view
                            of the 2 metrics, which was necessary as the cases greatly outnumbered the deaths.
                            <br/><br/>

            So far, you learned that it only takes a handful of people online
            to cause a profound social impact by spreading misinformation.
            You also learned that these people use misinformation to spread their narrative,
            to achieve political goals, or simply for personal profit.
            That fake news is not a recent thing, and even large mainstream
            media outlets have used it to gain popularity and make a quick buck.
            Misinformation destroyed lives and fortunes and, in spite of that, it is still ubiquitous in social media.

            That you can protect yourself against inflammatory language and manipulative wording meant to catch your attention?
            All of this is possible from one weird trick, one that we'll share with you.

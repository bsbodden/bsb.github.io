# Some of my recent work in AI and data science

## Projects

### NLP
* Research paper from last year on automatic fake news detection: [Automatic Fake News Detection: Are current models “fact-checking” or “gut-checking”?](https://aclanthology.org/2022.fever-1.4/) presented at FEVER at ACL 2022
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Ue97kzX8Q&t) provided for the online system for ACL 2022
* GitHub [repo](https://github.com/automatic-fake-news-detection) for the paper
* I gave an hour-long talk to the [NeuLab](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/) at Carnegie Mellon in July of 2022

### Vision for safety inspections
* August 30th article in Bloomberg ["9 Smart Ways To Make Cities Better"](https://archive.ph/SSPfv) mentioned my work on this project in part 6. Links to [PDF](./pdf/bloomberg.pdf) and [image of specific page.](./img/bloomberg-06.png)
* [How AI Could Have Warned Us about the Florida Condo Collapse Before It Happened](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-a-i-can-prevent-future-building-collapses-before-they-happen-71c3bf3740b5) article for Towards Data Science.
* The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4tnZTghSmg) for the TDS article (featured on the page, but here it is directly)

### Vision
* [Search and Rescue using YOLOv5](https://wandb.ai/iankelk/YOLOv5/reports/Search-and-Rescue-Augmentation-and-Preprocessing-on-Drone-Based-Water-Rescue-Images-with-YOLOv5---VmlldzoxOTk4MTI2?galleryTag=object-detection) using the Weights and Biases report
* Co-authored a [research paper](https://sp2023.ieee-security.org/program-papers.html) on physical adversarial attacks on face recognition systems for biometric security for S&P 2023: [ImU: Physical Impersonating Attack for Face Recognition System with Natural Style Changes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ewQSfJwTpHNtrRsdPiJNYB99_kcYtoCQ/view?usp=share_link)

* My [recorded presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzdyO1WmlEE) on the [Gist: Efficient Data Encoding for Deep Neural Network Training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/04/fiddle-gist-isca18.pdf) paper from Microsoft. Link to slides [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y4qM_qi-XI1kPqrZSM5u1yzr4aN5kxTOLejfJPO-5nA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Visualization
* JavaScript D3 Visualization [project](https://iankelk.github.io/fantastic-news/) on Fake News mostly focuses on COVID-19 propaganda (requires Chrome or Firefox on desktop). It was selected as [best project](https://www.cs171.org/2022/fame/) for the class in my Masters program.
* I recorded the 2-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8gTSvInKDA) for the project in an old-timey mid-Atlantic accent for uh, fun.

### Clarifai Blogs
* Blog [post](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/imperfections-in-the-machine-bias-in-ai) on AI bias
* Creating AI workflows [post](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/creating-workflows-in-clarifai-community)
* Clarifai Quick Start [post](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/image-predictions-quick-start)

### Clarifai Videos
* [Enhancing LLMs with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbuOu9zq2UE)
* [AI-assisted data labeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLMzm_vvMVg)
* [Auto Annotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q38eEf2dUoo)
* Something I created for a Webinar offered by Acquia / Widen (Digital Asset Management providers) for a demo on [generating ChatGPT prompts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQbEcf3lps) using image classification.

### Promotional Clarifai Videos
* I've created slick promotional loops used at tradeshows using Adobe After Effects.

	* Retail AI promotional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HMlx5SLobg)  

### Virmuze
* [Virmuze](https://virmuze.com/) is a startup of mine that I worked on for a while. The National Security Agency (NSA) uses it to host the National Cryptologic Museum's online exhibits. It's an unusual point of pride for me as I also helped them create much of the online exhibit content during the COVID-19 pandemic.

* [Link](https://virmuze.com/m/crypto-museum/) to the museum itself on Virmuze

### Database design
* I developed a [systems project](https://github.com/iankelk/cs265/) for a [research class](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/classes/cs265/) in big data systems in C++. 
* It's a fully functional, modern LSM-tree (Log Structured Merge tree) write-optimized NoSQL key-value store. It supports tiered, leveled, lazy-leveled, and partial compaction by percentage level policies. It also offers [MONKEY](https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/monkeykeyvaluestore.pdf) (Monkey: Optimal Navigable Key-Value Store) bloom filter optimization, internally multi-threaded range queries and compaction using a threadpool, and is also externally multi-threaded and can support multiple clients concurrently accessing the database with per-level blocking.
* Final report is located [here](reports/Final_Report_Ian_Kelk.pdf)
* A literature review on LSM tree key value stores is located [here](reports/Literature_Review_Ian_Kelk.pdf).

### Teaching
* Teaching fellow for Fall 2023, [CSCI E-89C Deep Reinforcement Learning.](https://courses.dce.harvard.edu/?details&srcdb=202401&crn=16817)
* I teach a weekly section on foundational and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and deep learning. I also grade assignments, and answer questions via class forum and email.
* Reinforcement learning topics include Markov Decision Processes (MDP), dynamic programming with the Bellman Equation, application of Monte Carlo methods in reinforcement contexts, temporal-difference Prediction & Control, including SARSA and Q-learning techniques, n-step TD and various Approximation Methods like stochastic-gradient, semi-gradient TD update, and Least-squares TD.
* Deep learning topics include techniques and principles behind training neural networks using backpropagation, strategies for tuning neural networks, with a focus on regularization, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
* Deep reinforcement learning topics include value-based deep RL using Q-networks, policy-based approaches in Deep RL with REINFORCE, asynchronous methods for deep RL, with a spotlight on advantage actor-critic (A2C).

### Harvard Extension Masters
* I'm a degree candidate for an ALM in Data Science. I've currently completed 9 classes out of a total of 10. I am currently taking [Productionizing AI (MLOps): AC215](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2023-AC215/), in which I am building a custom RAG system with an LLM that scrapes and answers questions on entire websites using LlamaIndex, Weaviate, LangChain, and GPT-3.5. It's hosted on Google Cloud Services and Google Cloud Storage, and uses Docker and Kubernetes for production use.

* I have maintained a 4.0 GPA in the following 9 classes:
	* Data Modeling (R)
	* Foundations of Data Science and Engineering (Python, SQL, Tableau)
	* Deep Learning for NLP (Research, Python, PyTorch)
	* Computer Vision (Python, Keras/TensorFlow)
	* Reinforcement Learning (Python)
	* Elements of Data Science and Statistical Learning with R (R)
	* Time Series Analysis with Python (Python)
	* Visualization (D3 JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tableau)
	* Big Data Systems (Research, C++)

1803	United Kingdom	51.5072	0.1276	none.jpg	Fake Peace Treaty	As Britain was preparing to end the Treaty of Amiens and declare war on France, a letter was hand delivered to Sir Charles Price, the Lord Mayor of London. Allegedly written by Lord Hawkesbury, the letter claimed that the dispute with France was amicably settled. The mayor took the letter to the Stock Exchange to share the joyous news. Meanwhile, suspicions about the validity of the letter were raised, and enquiries ensued. It was determined that the letter was indeed a forgery, but by then, it was too late. Many stocks had changed hands at inflated rates. All attempts to identify the perpetrator of the hoax failed.
1835	United States	40.7128	74.006	moon-wiki.jpg	Aliens on moon hoax	In a series of articles, the New York Sun claimed that there was an alien civilization on the moon, which were falsely attributed to a well-known astronomer of the time named Sir John Herschel. The article reported that Herschel had made these discoveries using new “hydro-oxygen magnifiers” and went on to describe how the discovery was made. This “Great Moon Hoax” established the Sun as a leading, profitable newspaper.
1890	United States	40.7128	74.006	yellow-journalism.jpg	Yellow Journalism	Rival U.S. newspaper publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Hearst competed over the audience through sensationalism and reporting rumours as though they were facts, a practice that became known at the time as “yellow journalism.” Their incredulous news played a role in leading the U.S. into the Spanish-American War of 1898. Eventually there was a backlash against the lack of journalistic integrity: The public demanded more objective and reliable news sources, which created a niche that The New York Times was able to fill at the turn of the 20th century. Yellow journalism became less common. That is, until the rise of web-based news brought it all back in full force.
1916	United States	41.8781	87.6298	eggs.jpg	Fake Eggs Price Drop	The price of eggs had risen to an unprecedented 80 cents a dozen in some parts of the U.S., and as a result, women decided to boycott eggs. There was a state-wide boycott of eggs planned by the women and public officials. Then, Chicago newspapers came out with headlines of “Eggs Drop Ten Cents” and “Cost of Living Smashed”. But the following day, it became apparent that this was nothing but fake news since the retail grocers in the city continued selling eggs at the same price. It was alleged that the newspapers were in cahoots with the food retailers. The prices continued to fluctuate with supply and demand and the cost of eggs continued to rise steadily in the years following the 1916 boycotts.
1917	United Kingdom	51.5072	0.1276	factory.jpg	Kadaver Factory	As World War One raged across Europe, both the Times and the Daily Mail in London published accounts from ‘anonymous sources’ that claimed they had visited a ‘Kadaver’ factory ‘ in Germany, which was said to extract glycerine from the corpses of the fallen to make soap and margarine. Now, long after the war, the story has been attributed to MI7, who spread this false story through the newspapers as a special correspondent for the Daily Express.
1938	United States	40.7128	74.006	war-worlds.jpg	War of the Worlds	The Columbia Broadcasting network aired an adaptation of the 1898 novel War of the Worlds by HG Wells. During the broadcast, the first two thirds of the story were aired over the radio as a series of breaking news alerts and the effect was so realistic that many listeners panicked, believing that there truly was an alien invasion taking place. Before the end of the broadcast, doctors, nurses, soldiers, and sailors reported for duty, ready to fight the Martians. Producers of the show were quite unprepared for this response, never thinking that anyone would believe that the broadcast was real.
1998	United States	40.7128	74.006	andrew-wakefield.jpg	Vaccines cause Autism	The scientific medical journal The Lancet published a paper by Andrew Wakefield which suggested a link between the measles, rumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination with a condition called "autistic enterocolitis". The paper, subsequently retracted, was based on manipulations of the data by Andrew Wakefield, who had financial interests in the sale of test kits for the "condition". Though the paper was retracted and Wakefield lost his medical license, vaccination for MMR dropped significantly after the publishing and outbreaks continue to happen in the 21st century.
2020	India	23.2156	72.6369	none.jpg	COVID-19 Cow Dung Cure	Almost straight from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of false and inaccurate information emerged, and was spread online. It was mainly about the COVID-19 virus, its origins and effects, cures and remedies, and the actions taken by the government or public health officials to manage the pandemic. One such "treatment" propagated in the province of Gujarat, in Western India, was to spread cow dung and urine on one's body to "ward off covid".
2022	Russia	55.7558	37.6173	none.jpg	Russo-Ukrainian fake news	As with many recent wars, also Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine was based on a lot of untruths, and in particular propaganda and disinformation. It continues to circulate strongly in both countries and the spreaders are employing coordinated efforts across multiple platforms, with social media such as Telegram and TikTok, mainstream media outlets, and propaganda-based websites all being used to sway the emotions and beliefs of ordinary citizens in the two countries and around the world.
